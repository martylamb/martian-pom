# martian-pom

Common parent pom for multiple martiansoftware.com projects.

To use, add the following to your pom (you really don't need this if you're not building a new martiansoftware.com project).

```xml
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.martiansoftware</groupId>
        <artifactId>martian-pom</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>       
    </parent>
```
